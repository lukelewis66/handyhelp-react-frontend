# HandyHelp Frontend

# Project Summary
- One sentence description: Virtual marketplace for individuals with unique skillsets to interact with people in need of such skills.
- Project Overview: 
Many people will have common household tasks or issues that they might not be able to do on their own, such as common repairs, yardwork, construction projects, etc. With HandyHelp, they can search for other people with specific skillsets that can help with their tasks. These users can make listings which describe the work needed, and other (contractor) users can respond and offer their help. 

Therefore, there will be two types of users-- clients and contractors. Clients can make listings that contractors can respond to, as well as look up specific contractors to contact. Contractors can advertise themselves and their own skillsets, which can be seen by clients. Both contractors and clients can make reviews/ratings of each other.

As of now, discussion of payments and the actual payments will be done at the client/contractor discretion. There could be possible integration of PayPal/Stripe API to make payments in the app in the future.
